# Agile Creations Questions and Answers API

## Overview and Results

A team of engineers and I developed a back end API for a single page e-commerce web application. We were given some legacy code from a front end system, and I was tasked with providing the dataset for the questions and answers section. We were also given csv data in the millions, so I performed an ETL process to load data into a database. The first decision I made was the type of database I wanted to use. Whether that was a SQL or NoSQL. I decided on utilyzing PosgreSQL as my RDBMS of choice. After I created my server using Express, I came across my second challenge which was making my queries optimized. At first I made queries on all of the tables, and shaped my data with vanilla JS. But I realized I can optimize my queries using postgres aggregate queries. I stress tested the queries with k6, and I was satisfied with the result of 4ms latency for 1000VUs. I then deployed my database and server with AWS EC2 instances, and I containerized my server image with Docker for faster deployment.
