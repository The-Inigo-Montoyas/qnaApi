# Agile Creations Questions and Answers API

## Overview and Results

A team of engineers and I developed a back end API for a single page e-commerce web application. We were given some legacy code from a front end system, and I was tasked with providing the dataset for the questions and answers section. We were also given csv data in the millions, so I performed an ETL process to load data into a database. The first decision I made was the type of database I wanted to use. Whether that was a SQL or NoSQL. I decided on utilyzing PosgreSQL as my RDBMS of choice.
